# TODO: the git version below is better: it's available over HTTPS and does not
# contain pre-build documentation that exists in the release tarball. In Debian
# we are *supposed* to rebuild this documentation, but that requires a load of
# extra build dependencies, some of which aren't in Debian atm. The original
# packager should have done this; and I don't have time for that atm, I just
# want to upgrade the OCaml compiler.
